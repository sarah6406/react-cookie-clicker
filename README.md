// USER STORIES
As a user, I want to be able to click on the seed packet and increment the counter by one seed.
As a user, I want to see the counter automatically increment using an interval timer.
As a user, I want to be able to get upgrades so that I have more seeds being produced per second, with an alert appearing if I cannot afford the seeds.

This is the most challenging project on the bootcamp so far. Having not long got my head around JS, it was a learning curve to implement React into my coding vocabulary. I like the idea of keeping code clean by storing it in reusable components, and passing in particular data in those components where necessary.
I have watched YouTube tutorials and read MDN docs to get more of an understanding of useState and useEffect in particular.
A stretch goal was to implement local storage - using code (which is commented out), local storage was able to keep my score upon page refresh, but appeared to have an error when deployed on Vercel. Will explore this further. I would also like to implement more upgrades, maybe taking to a different page for growing plants after a certain number of seeds has been reached.
